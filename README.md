# Stationery Sales System

This project was developed as part of an academic study to demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and the use of software design patterns in Python.

The system simulates a stationery sales environment, including product management, sales operations, and basic business logic. The main focus of the project is on clean code structure, modular design, and extensibility rather than a graphical user interface.

## Key Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Separation of responsibilities
- Reusable and maintainable code structure

## Design Patterns Used
- Factory Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Strategy Pattern  
(*Patterns may vary depending on implementation details.*)

## Features
- Product and category management
- Sales and order handling
- Price calculation and basic business rules
- Extensible architecture for future features

## Purpose
This project is intended for educational purposes and was created to practice object-oriented design and software architecture concepts in Python.

Further improvements are planned, such as adding persistence, user interaction, and additional design patterns.
